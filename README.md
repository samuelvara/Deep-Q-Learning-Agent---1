# Deep-Q-Learning-Agent---1

The player spawns on a 10x10 grid, with food and enemy spawned on the same grid.

The agent learns to avoid the enemy to finally reach the food in shortest distance.

The algorithm can still be tweaked by allowing the enemy and the food to move, this is done by just uncommenting enemy.move() and food.move().

The algorithm is optimized using Deep Q learning where Artificial Intelligence (CNN) is used to analyses each frame of the journey of the player to predict the optimized step for the player to take.

Inspired by https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf

Will update this repository with much more advanced functionalities using different move options and streamlined Deep Learning network.
