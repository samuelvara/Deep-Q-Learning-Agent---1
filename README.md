# Deep-Q-Learning-Agent---1

The agent spawns on a 10x10 grid, with food and enemy spawned on the same grid.

The agent learns to avoid the enemy to finally reach the food in shortest distance.

The algorithm can still be tweaked by allowing the enemy and the food to move, this is done by just uncommenting enemy.move() and food.move().
